## 🌟 Detailed Feature Matrix

### 1. 🎛️ Smart Account Dashboard
*   **Global Real-time Monitoring**: Instant insight into the health of all accounts, including average remaining quotas for Gemini Pro, Gemini Flash, Claude, and Gemini Image generation.
*   **Smart Recommendation**: The system uses a real-time algorithm to filter and recommend the "Best Account" based on quota redundancy, supporting **one-click switching**.
*   **Active Account Snapshot**: Visually displays the specific quota percentage and the last synchronization time of the currently active account.

### 2. 🔐 Professional AI Account Management & Proxy System
*   **OAuth 2.0 Authorization (Auto/Manual)**: Pre-generates a copyable authorization URL so you can finish auth in any browser; after the callback, the app auto-completes and saves the account (use “I already authorized, continue” if needed).
*   **Multi-dimensional Import**: Supports single token entry, JSON batch import, and automatic hot migration from V1 legacy databases.
*   **Gateway-level Views**: Supports switching between "List" and "Grid" views. Provides 403 Forbidden detection, automatically marking and skipping accounts with permission anomalies.

### 3.  Protocol Conversion & Relay (API Proxy)
*   **Multi-Protocol Adaptation (Multi-Sink)**:
    *   **OpenAI Format**: Provides `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint, compatible with 99% of existing AI apps.
    *   **Anthropic Format**: Provides native `/v1/messages` interface, supporting all features of **Claude Code CLI** (e.g., chain-of-thought, system prompts).
    *   **Gemini Format**: Supports direct calls from official Google AI SDKs.
*   **Smart Self-healing**: When a request encounters `429 (Too Many Requests)` or `401 (Expired)`, the backend triggers **millisecond-level automatic retry and silent rotation**, ensuring business continuity.

### 4. 🔀 Model Router Center
*   **Series-based Mapping**: Classify complex original model IDs into "Series Groups" (e.g., routing all GPT-4 requests uniformly to `gemini-3-pro-high`).
*   **Expert Redirection**: Supports custom regex-level model mapping for precise control over every request's landing model.
*   **Tiered Routing [New]**: Automatically prioritizes models based on account tiers (Ultra/Pro/Free) and reset frequencies to ensure stability for high-volume users.
*   **Silent Background Downgrading [New]**: Intelligently identifies background tasks (e.g., Claude CLI title generation) and reroutes them to Flash models to preserve premium quota.

### 5. 🎨 Multimodal & Imagen 3 Support
*   **Advanced Image Control**: Supports precise control over image generation tasks via OpenAI `size` (e.g., `1024x1024`, `16:9`) parameters or model name suffixes.
*   **Enhanced Payload Support**: The backend supports payloads up to **100MB** (configurable), more than enough for 4K HD image recognition and processing.

## 📥 Installation

### Option A: Terminal Installation (macOS & Linux Recommended)

#### macOS
If you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed, run:

```bash
# 1. Tap the repository
brew tap lbjlaq/antigravity-manager https://github.com/lbjlaq/Antigravity-Manager

# 2. Install the app
brew install --cask antigravity-tools
```
> **Tip**: If you encounter permission issues, add the `--no-quarantine` flag.

#### Arch Linux
You can choose to install via the one-click script or Homebrew:

**Option 1: One-click script (Recommended)**
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lbjlaq/Antigravity-Manager/main/deploy/arch/install.sh | bash
```

**Option 2: via Homebrew** (If you have [Linuxbrew](https://sh.brew.sh/) installed)
```bash
brew tap lbjlaq/antigravity-manager https://github.com/lbjlaq/Antigravity-Manager
brew install --cask antigravity-tools
```

#### Other Linux Distributions
The AppImage will be automatically symlinked to your binary path with executable permissions.

### Option B: Manual Download
Download from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/lbjlaq/Antigravity-Manager/releases):
*   **macOS**: `.dmg` (Universal, Apple Silicon & Intel)
*   **Windows**: `.msi` or portable `.zip`
*   **Linux**: `.deb` or `AppImage`

### Option C: Docker Deployment (Recommended for NAS/Servers)
If you prefer running in a containerized environment, we provide a native Docker image. This image supports the v4.0.3 Native Headless architecture, automatically hosts frontend static resources, and allows for direct browser-based management.

```bash
# Option 1: Direct Run (Recommended)
# - API_KEY: Required. Used for AI request authentication.
# - WEB_PASSWORD: Optional. Used for Web UI login. Defaults to API_KEY if NOT set.
docker run -d --name antigravity-manager \
  -p 8045:8045 \
  -e API_KEY=sk-your-api-key \
  -e WEB_PASSWORD=your-login-password \
  -e ABV_MAX_BODY_SIZE=104857600 \
  -v ~/.antigravity_tools:/root/.antigravity_tools \
  lbjlaq/antigravity-manager:latest

# Forgot keys? Run `docker logs antigravity-manager` or `grep -E '"api_key"|"admin_password"' ~/.antigravity_tools/gui_config.json`

#### 🔐 Authentication Scenarios
*   **Scenario A: Only `API_KEY` is set**
    - **Web Login**: Use `API_KEY` to access the dashboard.
    - **API Calls**: Use `API_KEY` for AI request authentication.
*   **Scenario B: Both `API_KEY` and `WEB_PASSWORD` are set (Recommended)**
    - **Web Login**: **Must** use `WEB_PASSWORD`. Using API Key will be rejected (more secure).
    - **API Calls**: Continue to use `API_KEY`. This allows you to share the API Key with team members while keeping the password for administrative access only.

#### 🆙 Upgrade Guide for Older Versions
If you are upgrading from v4.0.1 or earlier, your installation won't have a `WEB_PASSWORD` set by default. You can add one using any of these methods:
1.  **Web UI (Recommended)**: Log in using your existing `API_KEY`, go to the **API Proxy Settings** page, find the **Web UI Management Password** section below the API Key, set your new password, and save.
2.  **Environment Variable (Docker)**: Stop the old container and start the new one with the added parameter `-e WEB_PASSWORD=your_new_password`. **Note: Environment variables have the highest priority and will override any changes in the UI.**
3.  **Config File (Persistent)**: Directly edit `~/.antigravity_tools/gui_config.json` and add/modify `"admin_password": "your_new_password"` inside the `proxy` object.
    - *Note: `WEB_PASSWORD` is the environment variable name, while `admin_password` is the JSON key in the config file.*

> [!TIP]
> **Priority Logic**:
> - **Environment Variable** (`WEB_PASSWORD`) has the highest priority. If set, the application will always use it and ignore values in the configuration file.
> - **Configuration File** (`gui_config.json`) is used for persistent storage. When you change the password via Web UI and save, it is written here.
> - **Fallback**: If neither is set, it falls back to `API_KEY`; if even `API_KEY` is missing, a random one is generated.

# Option 2: Use Docker Compose
# 1. Enter the Docker directory
cd docker
# 2. Start the service
docker compose up -d
```
> **Access URL**: `http://localhost:8045` (Admin Console) | `http://localhost:8045/v1` (API Base)
> **System Requirements**:
> - **RAM**: **1GB** recommended (minimum 256MB).
> - **Persistence**: Mount `/root/.antigravity_tools` to persist your data.
> - **Architecture**: Supports x86_64 and ARM64.
> **See**: [Docker Deployment Guide (docker)](./docker/README.md)

### 🛠️ Troubleshooting

#### macOS says "App is damaged"?
Due to macOS security gatekeeper, non-App Store apps might show this. Run this in Terminal to fix:
```bash
sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Antigravity Tools.app"
```

## 🔌 Quick Integration Examples

### 🔐 OAuth Authorization Flow (Add Account)
1. Go to `Accounts` → `Add Account` → `OAuth`.
2. The dialog pre-generates an authorization URL before you click any button. Click the URL to copy it to the system clipboard, then open it in the browser you prefer and complete authorization.
3. After consent, the browser opens a local callback page and shows “✅ Authorized successfully!”.
4. The app automatically continues the flow and saves the account; if it doesn’t, click “I already authorized, continue” to finish manually.

> Note: the auth URL contains a one-time local callback port. Always use the latest URL shown in the dialog. If the app isn’t running or the dialog is closed during auth, the browser may show `localhost refused connection`.

### How to use with Claude Code CLI?
1. Start Antigravity service in the "API Proxy" tab.
2. In your terminal:
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-antigravity"
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL="http://127.0.0.1:8045"
claude
```

### How to use in Python?
```python
import openai

client = openai.OpenAI(
    api_key="sk-antigravity",
    base_url="http://127.0.0.1:8045/v1"
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gemini-3-flash",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, please introduce yourself"}]
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

## 📝 Developer & Community

*   **Changelog**:
    *   **v4.1.4 (2026-02-05)**:
        -   **[Core Feature] Proxy Pool Persistence & Account Filtering Optimization (PR #1565)**:
            -   **Persistence Enhancement**: Fixed an issue where proxy pool bindings were not correctly restored after proxy service restart or reload, ensuring strict persistence of binding relationships.
            -   **Intelligent Filtering**: Optimized account acquisition logic in `TokenManager`. Added deep validation for `disabled` and `proxy_disabled` statuses in loading, syncing, and scheduling paths to prevent disabled accounts from being mistakenly selected.
            -   **Validation Block Support**: Introduced the `validation_blocked` field system to handle Google's `VALIDATION_REQUIRED` (403 temporary risk control) scenarios, implementing intelligent automatic bypass based on expiration time.
            -   **State Cleanup Fortification**: Synchronized cleanup of memory tokens, rate limit records, session bindings, and preferred account flags when an account becomes invalid, ensuring consistency of the internal state machine.
        -   **[Core Fix] Fix Critical Compatibility Issues in Web/Docker Mode (Issue #1574)**:
            -   **Debug Mode Fix**: Corrected frontend debug console URL mapping errors (removed redundant `/proxy` path), resolving the issue where debug mode could not be enabled in Web mode.
            -   **Fingerprint Binding Fix**: Added `BindDeviceProfileWrapper` structure for the `admin_bind_device_profile_with_profile` interface, fixing HTTP 422 errors caused by nested parameters sent from the frontend.
            -   **Backward Compatibility**: Used `serde alias` feature to support both camelCase (frontend) and snake_case (backend files) at the API layer, ensuring old account files load correctly.
        -   **[Code Optimization] Simplified API Handling Structure**:
            -   Removed redundant `Wrapper` layers in multiple management API routes (e.g., IP blacklist/whitelist management, security setting updates), directly destructuring business models to improve code conciseness and development efficiency.
        -   **[Core Fix] Resolve OpenCode Thinking Model Interruption Issue (Issue #1575)**:
            -   **finish_reason Enforcement**: Fixed the issue where `finish_reason` was incorrectly set to `stop` during tool calls, causing OpenAI clients to prematurely terminate conversations. The system now forcibly sets `finish_reason` to `tool_calls` when tool calls are present, ensuring proper tool loop execution.
            -   **Tool Parameter Standardization**: Implemented automatic standardization of shell tool parameter names, converting non-standard names like `cmd`/`code`/`script` (which Gemini may generate) to the standard `command` parameter, improving tool call compatibility.
            -   **Impact Scope**: Fixed the tool call workflow for Thinking models (e.g., `claude-sonnet-4-5-thinking`) under the OpenAI protocol, resolving interruption issues in clients like OpenCode.
    *   **v4.1.4 (2026-02-05)**:
        - **Bug Fixes**:
            - **Gemini Native Protocol Image Generation Parameter Support (Issue #1573)**: Fixed the issue where `generationConfig.imageConfig` parameters were ignored when using the Gemini native protocol. The system now correctly parses and applies image configuration parameters such as `aspectRatio` and `imageSize`.
                - **Priority Strategy**: Prioritizes parsing parameters from the request body's `generationConfig.imageConfig`, while retaining model name suffix as a backward-compatible fallback.
                - **Protocol Consistency**: Ensures unified parameter handling logic for image generation across Gemini, OpenAI, and Claude protocols.
                - **Impact Scope**: Fixed the call chain across 9 files, including core modules like `common_utils.rs`, `gemini.rs`, and `wrapper.rs`.
    *   **v4.1.3 (2026-02-05)**:
        -   **[Core Fix] Resolve Security Config and IP Management Failures in Web/Docker Mode (Issue #1560)**:
            -   **Protocol Alignment**: Fixed the issue where the backend Axum interface could not parse nested parameter formats (e.g., `{"config": ...}`) wrapped by the frontend `invoke` method, ensuring security configurations are correctly persisted.
            -   **Parameter Normalization**: Added `camelCase` renaming support for IP management interfaces, resolving failures in adding or deleting entries caused by case mismatches in Web-mode Query parameters.
        -   **[Core Fix] Restore Gemini Pro Thinking Blocks (Issue #1557)**:
            -   **Cross-Protocol Alignment**: Resolved the issue where `gemini-3-pro` and other reasoning models were missing thinking blocks in OpenAI, Claude, and Gemini protocols since v4.1.0.
            -   **Smart Injection Logic**: Implemented automatic `thinkingConfig` injection and default-enablement mechanisms, ensuring thinking features are correctly activated even when not explicitly requested by clients.
            -   **Robustness Enhancement**: Optimized internal type handling in `wrapper.rs` to prevent configuration conflicts in high-concurrency scenarios.
    *   **v4.1.2 (2026-02-05)**:
        -   **[Core Feature] ClientAdapter Framework (Issue #1522)**:
            -   **Architecture Refactor**: Introduced `ClientAdapter` framework with `Arc` reference counting to fully decouple handler logic from downstream client specifics, ensuring thread-safe sharing.
            -   **Full Protocol Compatibility**: Achieved seamless integration for **4 protocols** (Claude/OpenAI/Gemini/OA-Compatible) specifically for third-party clients like `opencode`, eliminating `AI_TypeValidationError`.
            -   **Smart Strategies**: Implemented FIFO signature buffering and `let_it_crash` fail-fast mechanism to significantly improve stability and error feedback in high-concurrency scenarios.
            -   **Standardized Error Responses**: Unified error formats across all protocols (SSE `event: error` / Non-stream JSON), ensuring clients can correctly parse upstream exceptions.
        -   **[Core Fix] Unified Account Disable Status Check Logic (Issue #1512)**:
            -   **Logic Alignment**: Fixed an issue where the manual disable status (`proxy_disabled`) was ignored in batch quota refresh and auto-warmup logic.
            -   **Background Noise Reduction**: Ensured that accounts marked as "Disabled" or "Proxy Disabled" no longer trigger any background network requests, enhancing privacy and resource efficiency.
        -   **[Core Fix] Resolve 400 Invalid Argument Errors in OpenAI Protocol (Issue #1506)**:
            -   **Session-level Signature Isolation**: Integrated `SignatureCache` to physically isolate thinking signatures using `session_id`, preventing signature cross-contamination in multi-turn or concurrent sessions.
            -   **Enhanced Robustness**: Added logic to recognize and automatically clean invalid thinking placeholders (e.g., `[undefined]`), improving compatibility with various clients like Cherry Studio.
            -   **Full-link Context Propagation**: Refactored request mapping and streaming chains to ensure precise Session context propagation across both non-streaming and streaming requests.
        -   **[UI Enhancement] Model Logo Support & Automatic Sorting (PR #1535)**:
            -   **Visual Excellence**: Integrated `@lobehub/icons` to display brand-specific logos for models in account cards, tables, and dialogs.
            -   **Smart Sorting**: Implemented a weight-based model sorting algorithm (Series > Tier > Suffix) to prioritize primary models like Gemini 3 Pro.
            -   **Configuration Centralization**: Decoupled model metadata (Labels, Short Names, Icons, and Weights), improving codebase maintainability.
            -   **i18n Synchronization**: Updated model display names across 13 languages.
        -   **[Core Fix] Enhanced Account Disable Status & Real-time Disk State Verification (PR #1546)**:
            -   **Deep Disk Verification**: Introduced a `get_account_state_on_disk` mechanism that adds a second-layer status confirmation on the token acquisition path, completely resolving issues with disabled accounts being selected due to memory cache latency.
            -   **Smart Fixed Account Sync**: Optimized the `toggle_proxy_status` command to automatically disable fixed account mode when an account is disabled and trigger an immediate proxy pool reload.
            -   **Auth Failure Self-healing**: When the backend detects an `invalid_grant` error and auto-disables an account, it now physically purges in-memory tokens, rate limit records, and session bindings, ensuring immediate offline status for faulty accounts.
            -   **End-to-end Filtering**: Integrated disable status checks into the Warmup logic and Scheduler, significantly reducing redundant background network requests.
        -   **[Core Optimization] Concurrent Proxy Pool Health Checks (PR #1547)**:
            -   **Performance Boost**: Integrated a concurrent execution mechanism based on `futures` streams, refactoring sequential checks into parallel processing (concurrency limit: 20).
            -   **Efficiency Enhancement**: Significantly reduced the total duration of health checks for large proxy pools, improving the system's responsiveness to proxy status changes.
        -   **[Core Fix] Resolve crypto.randomUUID Compatibility in Docker/HTTP (Issue #1548)**:
            -   **Crash Fix**: Resolved application crashes ("Unexpected Application Error") and batch import failures in non-secure contexts (e.g., HTTP or partial Docker environments) where the browser disables the `crypto.randomUUID` API.
            -   **Compatibility**: Introduced a cross-platform compatible UUID generation fallback mechanism, ensuring ID generation stability in any deployment environment.
    *   **v4.1.1 (2026-02-04)**:
        -   **[Core Feature] Update Checker Enhanced (Update Checker 2.0) (PR #1494)**:
            -   **Proxy Support**: The update checker now fully respects the global upstream proxy configuration.
            -   **Multi-layer Fallback**: Implemented a 3-layer fallback strategy: `GitHub API -> GitHub Raw -> jsDelivr`, significantly improving update detection reliability.
            -   **Observability**: The update notification now displays the source of the detection.
        -   **[Core Optimization] Antigravity Database Compatibility Improvement (>= 1.16.5)**:
            -   **Smart Version Detection**: Added a cross-platform version detection module (macOS/Windows/Linux) to automatically identify the Antigravity client version.
            -   **Format Adaptation**: Supported the new `antigravityUnifiedStateSync.oauthToken` format for v1.16.5+ while maintaining backward compatibility for legacy formats.
            -   **Smart Injection**: Implemented a version-aware injection strategy with a dual-format fallback mechanism to ensure seamless account switching.
        -   **[Core Fix] Resolve react-router SSR XSS Vulnerability (CVE-2026-21884) (PR #1500)**:
            -   **Security Fix**: Upgraded `react-router` dependency to a safe version, addressing a cross-site scripting (XSS) risk in the `ScrollRestoration` component during server-side rendering (SSR).
        -   **[i18n] Enhanced Japanese Translation Support (PR #1524)**:
            -   **Improvement**: Completed Japanese localization for critical modules including Proxy Pool, streaming error messages, and User-Agent configurations.
    *   **v4.1.0 (2026-02-04)**:
        -   **[Major Update] Proxy Pool 2.0 & Stability Enhancements**:
            -   **Account-level Exclusive IP Isolation**: Implemented strong binding between accounts and proxies. Bound proxies are automatically isolated from the public pool.
            -   **Protocol Auto-completion**: Backend now automatically handles short-hand inputs (e.g., `ip:port`) by prepending `http://`.
            -   **Intelligent Health Check**: Added browser-like User-Agent to prevent blocks and switched default fallback check URL to `cloudflare.com`.
            -   **Responsive Status Sync**: Fixed the "sleep-before-check" logic, ensuring immediate UI status updates on startup.
            -   **Persistence Bug Fix**: Resolved race conditions where high-frequency polling could rollback manual proxy additions.
        -   **Proxy Pool 2.0 Logic Breakdown**:
            -   **Scene 1: Full-chain Locking** — Once Account A is bound to Node-01, all requests (Token refresh, Quota sync, AI inference) are forced through Node-01. Google sees a consistent IP for the account.
            -   **Scene 2: Auto-Isolation for Public Pool** — Account B has no binding. Node-01 is automatically excluded from the public rotation as it's exclusively used by A, eliminating association risks.
            -   **Scene 3: Self-healing & Failover** — If Node-01 fails and "Auto failover" is on, Account A temporarily borrows from the public pool for urgent tasks (e.g., Token refresh) with audit logs.
        -   **[New Feature] UserToken Page & Monitoring Enhancements (PR #1475)**:
            -   **Page Navigation**: Added dedicated UserToken management page for granular token control.
            -   **Monitoring**: Enhanced system monitoring and routing integration for better observability.

        -   **[Core Fix] Resolve Google OAuth Non-Localhost Callback Restriction (Fix Issue #1186)**:
            -   **Issue Context**: Google does not support using non-localhost private IPs as callback URLs in OAuth flows, triggering "Unsafe App" warnings even with `device_id` injection.
            -   **Solution**: Introduced a standardized "Manual OAuth Submission" flow. When the browser cannot auto-redirect to localhost (e.g., remote deployment), users can manually paste the callback URL or auth code to complete authorization.
            - **Enhancement**: Refactored the manual submission UI with full i18n support (9 languages) and polished interactions, ensuring successful account addition in any network environment.
        -   **[Core Fix] Resolve Google Cloud Code API 429 Errors (Fix Issue #1176)**:
            - **Smart Fallback**: Migrated default API traffic to the more stable Daily/Sandbox environments, bypassing frequent 429 errors currently affecting the production environment (`cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com`).
            - **Enhanced Robustness**: Implemented a three-level fallback strategy (Sandbox -> Daily -> Prod) to ensure high availability of core business flows under extreme network conditions.
        -   **[Core Optimization] Account Scheduling Algorithm Upgrade**:
            - **Health Score System**: Introduced a real-time health score (0.0 to 1.0). Failures (e.g., 429/5xx) significantly penalize the score to demote impaired accounts, while successful requests gradually restore scores for intelligent self-healing.
            - **Tiered Smart Prioritization**: Re-engineered scheduling priority to `Subscription Tier > Remaining Quota > Health Score`. Ensures that among accounts with the same tier and quota, the most stable one is always prioritized.
            - **Throttle Delay Mechanism**: In extreme rate-limiting scenarios, if all accounts are locked but one is due to recover within 2s, the system will automatically suspend the thread to wait instead of erroring out. This markedly improves high-concurrency stability and session stickiness.
            - **Full Protocol Integration**: Refactored the `TokenManager` core interface and completed synchronized adaptation for all handlers (Claude, Gemini, OpenAI, Audio, Warmup), ensuring scheduling changes are transparent to business logic.
        -   **[Core Fix] Persist Fixed Account Mode Setting (PR #1209)**:
            -   **Issue**: The Fixed Account Mode setting was reset after service restart in previous versions.

    *   **v4.0.2 (2026-01-26)**:
        -   **[Core Fix] Session Persistence After Account Switch (Fix Issue #1159)**:
            - Enhanced database injection logic to synchronize identity info (Email) and clear legacy UserID cache during account switching.
            - Resolved session association failures caused by mismatches between the new Token and old identity metadata.
        -   **[Core Fix] Model Mapping Persistence in Docker/Web Mode (Fix Issue #1149)**:
            - Resolved an issue where model mapping configurations modified via API in Docker or Web deployment modes were not saved to disk.
            - Ensured the `admin_update_model_mapping` interface correctly invokes persistence logic, so configurations remain effective after container restarts.
        -   **[Architecture Optimization] MCP Tool Support Architecture Upgrade (Schema Cleaning & Tool Adapters)**:
            - **Constraint Semantic Backfilling (Constraint Hints)**:
                - Implemented intelligent constraint migration mechanism that converts unsupported constraint fields (`minLength`, `pattern`, `format`, etc.) into description hints before removal.
                - Added `CONSTRAINT_FIELDS` constant and `move_constraints_to_description` function to ensure models can understand original constraints through descriptions.
                - Example: `{"minLength": 5}` → `{"description": "[Constraint: minLen: 5]"}`
            - **Enhanced anyOf/oneOf Intelligent Flattening**:
                - Rewrote `extract_best_schema_from_union` function with scoring mechanism to select the best type (object > array > scalar).
                - Automatically adds `"Accepts: type1 | type2"` hints to descriptions after merging, preserving all possible type information.
                - Added `get_schema_type_name` function supporting explicit types and structural inference.
            - **Pluggable Tool Adapter Layer (Tool Adapter System)**:
                - Created `ToolAdapter` trait providing customized Schema processing capabilities for different MCP tools.
                - Implemented `PencilAdapter` that automatically adds descriptions for Pencil drawing tool's visual properties (`cornerRadius`, `strokeWidth`) and path parameters.
                - Established global adapter registry supporting tool-specific optimizations via `clean_json_schema_for_tool` function.
            - **High-Performance Cache Layer (Schema Cache)**:
                - Implemented SHA-256 hash-based Schema caching mechanism to avoid redundant cleaning of identical schemas.
                - Uses LRU eviction strategy with max 1000 entries, memory usage < 10MB.
                - Provides `clean_json_schema_cached` function and cache statistics, expected 60%+ performance improvement.
            - **Impact**: 
                - ✅ Significantly improves Schema compatibility and model understanding for MCP tools (e.g., Pencil)
                - ✅ Establishes pluggable foundation for adding more MCP tools (filesystem, database, etc.) in the future
                - ✅ Fully backward compatible, all 25 tests passing
        -   **[Security Enhancement] Web UI Management Password & API Key Separation (Fix Issue #1139)**:
            - **Independent Password Configuration**: Support setting a separate management console login password via `ABV_WEB_PASSWORD` or `WEB_PASSWORD` environment variables.
            - **Intelligent Authentication Logic**: 
                - Management interfaces prioritize validating the independent password, automatically falling back to `API_KEY` if not set (ensuring backward compatibility).
                - AI Proxy interfaces strictly only allow `API_KEY` for authentication, achieving permission isolation.
            - **Configuration UI Support**: Added a management password editing item in "Dashboard - Service Config," supporting one-click retrieval or modification.
            - **Log Guidance**: Headless mode startup clearly prints the status and retrieval methods for both API Key and Web UI Password.
    *   **v4.0.1 (2026-01-26)**:
        -   **[UX Optimization] Theme & Language Transition Smoothness**:

            -   **Issue**: Addressed an issue where Gemini models would unexpectedly terminate the stream after outputting "Thinking" content, causing Claude clients to receive 0-token responses and deadlock with errors.
            -   **Defense Mechanism**:
                - **State Tracking**: Real-time monitoring of streaming responses to detect "Thinking-only" states (Thinking sent, Content pending).
                - **Auto-Recovery**: Upon detecting such interruptions, the system automatically closes the Thinking block, injects a system notice, and simulates valid Usage data to ensure the client terminates the session gracefully.
        -   **[Core Fix] Removed Flash Lite Model to Fix 429 Errors**:
            -   **Issue**: Observed that `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` is frequently returning 429 errors today due to **Upstream Google Container Capacity Exhausted** (MODEL_CAPACITY_EXHAUSTED), rather than standard account quota limits.
            -   **Urgent Fix**: Replaced all internal `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` calls (e.g., background title generation, L3 summary compression) and preset mappings with the more stable `gemini-2.5-flash`.
            -   **User Notice**: If you explicitly used `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` in "Custom Mappings" or "Presets", please update it to another model immediately, or you may continue to experience 429 errors.

    *   **v3.3.47 (2026-01-21)**:
        -   **[Core Fix] Image Generation API Parameter Mapping Enhancement (Fix Issue #911)**:
            -   **Background**: The `/v1/images/generations` endpoint had two parameter mapping defects:
                - The `size` parameter only supported hardcoded specific dimension strings; OpenAI standard sizes (like `1280x720`) were incorrectly fallback to `1:1` aspect ratio
                - The `quality` parameter was only used for Prompt enhancement and not mapped to Gemini's `imageSize`, unable to control the physical resolution of output images
            -   **Fix Details**:
                - **Extended `common_utils.rs`**: Added `parse_image_config_with_params` function to support parsing image configuration from OpenAI parameters (`size`, `quality`)
                - **Dynamic Aspect Ratio Calculation**: Added `calculate_aspect_ratio_from_size` function, using mathematical calculation instead of hardcoded matching, supporting any `WIDTHxHEIGHT` format
                - **Unified Configuration Parsing**: Modified `handle_images_generations` function, removed hardcoded mapping, calling unified configuration parsing function
                - **Parameter Mapping**: `quality: "hd"` → `imageSize: "4K"`, `quality: "medium"` → `imageSize: "2K"`
            -   **Test Verification**: Added 8 unit tests covering OpenAI parameter parsing, dynamic calculation, backward compatibility scenarios, all passing
            -   **Compatibility Guarantee**:
                - ✅ Backward Compatible: Chat path (like `gemini-3-pro-image-16-9-4k`) still works normally
                - ✅ Progressive Enhancement: Supports more OpenAI standard sizes, `quality` parameter correctly mapped
                - ✅ No Breaking Changes: Claude, Vertex, Gemini protocols unaffected
            -   **Impact**: Resolved OpenAI Images API parameter mapping issues, all protocols automatically benefit through `common_utils`
        -   **[Core Optimization] 3-Layer Progressive Context Compression**:
            -   **Background**: Long conversations frequently trigger "Prompt is too long" errors, manual `/compact` is tedious, and existing compression strategies break LLM's KV Cache, causing cost spikes
            -   **Solution - Multi-Layer Progressive Compression Strategy**:
                - **Layer 1 (60% pressure)**: Intelligent Tool Message Trimming
                    - Removes old tool call/result messages, retains last 5 rounds of interaction
                    - **Completely preserves KV Cache** (only deletes messages, doesn't modify content)
                    - Compression rate: 60-90%
                - **Layer 2 (75% pressure)**: Thinking Content Compression + Signature Preservation

        -   **[Core Fix] Remove [DONE] from Stop Sequences to Prevent Truncation (PR #889)**:
            -   **Background**: `[DONE]` is a standard SSE (Server-Sent Events) protocol end signal that frequently appears in code and documentation. Including it as a `stopSequence` caused unexpected output truncation when the model explained SSE-related content.
            -   **Fix Details**: Removed the `"[DONE]"` marker from the Gemini request's `stopSequences` array.
            -   **Technical Notes**:
                - Gemini stream termination is controlled by the `finishReason` field, not `stopSequence`
                - SSE-level `"data: [DONE]"` is handled separately in `mod.rs`
            -   **Impact**: Resolved the issue where model output was prematurely terminated when generating content containing SSE protocol explanations, code examples, etc. (Issue #888).
        -   **[Deployment] Docker Build Dual-Mode Adaptation (Default/China Mode)**:
            -   **Dual-Mode Architecture**: Introduced `ARG USE_CHINA_MIRROR` build argument. The default mode keeps the original Debian official sources (ideal for overseas/cloud builds); when enabled, it automatically switches to Tsinghua University (TUNA) mirrors (optimized for mainland China).

            -   **Major Fix**: Resolved OpenAI protocol 404 errors and fixed a compatibility defect where Codex (`/v1/responses`) with complex object array `input` or custom tools like `apply_patch` (missing schema) caused upstream 400 (`INVALID_ARGUMENT`) errors.
            -   **Thinking Model Optimization**: Resolved mandatory error issues with Claude 3.7 Thinking models when thought chains are missing in historical messages, implementing intelligent protocol fallback and placeholder block injection.
            -   **Protocol Completion**: Enhanced OpenAI Legacy endpoints with Token usage statistics and Header injection. Added support for `input_text` content blocks and mapped the `developer` role to system instructions.
            -   **requestId Unification**: Unified `requestId` prefix to `agent-` across all OpenAI paths to resolve ID recognition issues with some clients. interface response bodies, resolving the issue where token consumption was not displayed in traffic logs.
        -   **[Core Fix] JSON Schema Array Recursive Cleaning Fix (Resolution of Gemini API 400 Errors)**:
            -   **Issue**: Complex nested array schemas in tool definitions (like `apply_patch` or `local_shell_call`) were not being recursively cleaned, leading to 400 errors from Gemini API due to unsupported fields like `const` or `propertyNames`.
            -   **Fix**: Implemented full recursive cleaning for all `Value::Array` types in the JSON Schema processor.
            -   **Impact**: Significantly improves compatibility with tools that use complex array schemas.

            - **Schema Context Detection Lock**: Added a safety check to ensure the cleaner only operates on actual Schema nodes. This "precision lock" protects tool call structures in `request.rs`, ensuring the stability of historical fixes (e.g., boolean coercion, shell array conversion).
    *   **v3.3.41 (2026-01-18)**:
        - **Claude Protocol Core Compatibility Fixes (Issue #813)**:
            - **Consecutive User Message Merging**: Implemented `merge_consecutive_messages` logic to automatically merge consecutive messages with the same role. This resolves 400 Bad Request errors caused by role alternation violations during Spec/Plan mode switches.
            - **EnterPlanMode Protocol Alignment**: For Claude Code's `EnterPlanMode` tool calls, redundant arguments are now forcibly cleared to ensure full compliance with the official protocol, fixing instruction set validation failures.
        - **Proxy Robustness Enhancements**:
            - Enhanced self-healing capabilities for tool call chains. When the model generates erroneous paths due to hallucinations, the Proxy now provides standard error feedback to guide the model back to the correct path.

    *   **v3.3.40 (2026-01-18)**:
        - **Deep Fix for API 400 Errors (Grep/Thinking Stability)**:
            - **Resolved Protocol Order Violation**: Fixed the "Found 'text' instead of 'thinking'" 400 error by refactoring `streaming.rs` to stop appending illegal thinking blocks after text blocks. Signatures are now silently cached for recovery.
            - **Enhanced Thinking Signature Self-healing**: Expanded 400 error keyword capture in `claude.rs` to cover signature invalidation, sequence errors, and protocol mismatches. Implemented millisecond-level silent retries with automated session healing.
            - **Search Tool Schema Alignment**: Corrected parameter remapping for `Grep` and `Glob` tools, ensuring `query` is accurately mapped to `path` as per Claude Code Schema, with automatic injection of default path `.`.
            - **Optimized Tool Renaming Strategy**: Refined the renaming logic to only target known hallucinations (like `search`), preserving the integrity of original tool call signatures.
            - **Automatic Signature Completion**: For tool calls like LS, Bash, and TodoWrite that missing `thought_signature`, the proxy now automatically injects a placeholder to satisfy upstream constraints.
        - **Architectural Robustness**:
            - Enhanced the global recursive cleaner `clean_cache_control_from_messages` to strip illegal `cache_control` tags that disrupt Vertex AI/Anthropic strict mode.
            - Updated comprehensive test examples in [docs/client_test_examples.md](docs/client_test_examples.md) covering all known 400 error scenarios.
    *   **v3.3.39 (2026-01-17)**:
        - **Deep Proxy Optimizations (Gemini Stability Boost)**:
            - **Schema Purifier Upgrade**: Supported `allOf` merging, intelligent union type selection, automatic Nullable filtering, and empty object parameter backfill, completely resolving 400 errors caused by complex tool definitions.
            - **Search Tool Self-healing**: Implemented automatic remapping from `Search` to `grep` and introduced **Glob-to-Include Migration** (automatically moving Glob patterns like `**/*.rs` to the inclusion parameter), resolving Claude Code `Error searching files` errors.
            - **Parameter Alias Completion**: Unified parameter mapping logic for `search_code_definitions` and other related tools, and enforced boolean type conversion.
            - **Shell Call Robustness**: Enforced `local_shell_call` command parameter to return as an array, enhancing compatibility with Google API.
            - **Dynamic Token Constraints**: Automatically adjusted `maxOutputTokens` based on `thinking_budget` to satisfy strict API constraints; streamlined Stop Sequences to improve streaming output quality.
        - **Enhanced Thinking Mode Stability**:
            - Introduced cross-model family signature validation to automatically downgrade incompatible thinking signatures, preventing 400 Bad Request errors.
            - Improved "Session Healing" logic to automatically recover interrupted tool loops and ensure compliance with strict Google/Vertex AI structural requirements.
        - **High Availability Improvements**:
            - Optimized automatic Endpoint Fallback logic for smoother transitions to backup API endpoints during 429 or 5xx errors.
        - **Fix macOS "Too many open files" Error (Issue #784)**:
            - Implemented a global shared HTTP client pool to significantly reduce Socket handle consumption.
            - Automatically increase the file descriptor limit (RLIMIT_NOFILE) to 4096 on macOS for enhanced high-concurrency stability.
    *   **v3.3.38 (2026-01-17)**:
        - **Thinking Signature Deep Fix & Session Healing (Core Fix)**:
            - **Robust Retry Logic**: Fixed the retry counting logic to ensure single-account users can still trigger internal retries for signature errors, improving auto-recovery rates.
            - **Proactive Signature Stripping**: Introduced `is_retry` flag to forcibly strip all historical signatures during retry attempts. Coupled with strict model family validation (no more signature mixing between Gemini 1.5 and 2.0), this eliminates 400 errors from invalid signatures.
            - **Session Healing**: Implemented smart message injection to satisfy Vertex AI structural constraints when tool results lack preceding thinking blocks due to stripping.
        - **Pinned Quota Models**:
            - **Customizable Display**: Added a model quota pinning list in "Settings -> Account", allowing users to customize specific model quotas displayed in the main table; unselected models are only shown in detail modals.
            - **Layout Optimization**: Implemented a responsive 4-column grid layout for this section, maintaining UI consistency with the "Quota Protection" module.
        - **Relay Stability Enhancements**: Improved detection and backoff for 529 Overloaded errors, increasing task success rates under extreme upstream load.
    *   **v3.3.37 (2026-01-17)**:
        - **Backend Compatibility Fix (Fix PR #772)**:
            - **Backward Compatibility Enhancement**: Added `#[serde(default)]` attribute to `StickySessionConfig`, ensuring that old configuration files (missing sticky session fields) can be correctly loaded, preventing deserialization errors.
        - **User Experience Optimization (Fix PR #772)**:
            - **Config Loading Upgrade**: Introduced dedicated loading state and error handling in `ApiProxy.tsx`. Users now see a loading spinner while fetching configuration, and if loading fails, a clear error message with a retry button is displayed instead of a blank or broken state.
        - **macOS Monterey Sandbox Permissions Fix (Fix Issue #468)**:
            - **Root Cause**: On older macOS versions like Monterey (12.x), application sandbox policies prevented reading global preferences (`kCFPreferencesAnyApplication`), causing failure to detect the default browser and blocking OAuth redirects.
            - **Fix**: Added `com.apple.security.temporary-exception.shared-preference.read-only` exception to `Entitlements.plist`, explicitly allowing read access to global configurations.
    *   **v3.3.36 (2026-01-17)**:
        - **Core Stability Fixes for Claude Protocol**:
            - **"Reply OK" Loop Fix (History Poisoning)**:
                - **Root Cause**: Fixed a critical flaw in `is_warmup_request` logic. The old logic scanned the last 10 historical messages; once any "Warmup" message appeared in history (user-sent or background heartbeat), the system would misidentify all subsequent user inputs (like "continue") as Warmup requests and force an "OK" response.
                - **Fix**: Restricted detection scope to check ONLY the **latest** message. Now valid user inputs are processed correctly, and only actual Warmup heartbeats are intercepted.
                - **Impact**: Significantly improved usability for Claude Code CLI and Cherry Studio in long-running sessions.
            - **Cache Control Injection Fix (Fix Issue #744)**:
                - **Root Cause**: Claude clients injected non-standard `cache_control: {"type": "ephemeral"}` fields into Thinking blocks, causing Google API to return `Extra inputs are not permitted` 400 errors.
                - **Fix**: Implemented a global recursive cleanup function `clean_cache_control_from_messages` and integrated it into the Anthropic (z.ai) forwarding path, ensuring all `cache_control` fields are stripped before sending to upstream APIs.
            - **Comprehensive Signature Defense**:
                - **Implicit Fixes**: Deep code audit confirmed that a series of previously reported signature-related issues (#755, #654, #653, #639, #617) are effectively resolved by the **strict signature validation**, **automatic downgrade**, and **Base64 smart decoding** mechanisms introduced in v3.3.35. The system now has high fault tolerance for missing, corrupted, or malformed signatures.
        - **Smart Warmup Logic Fix (Fix Issue #760)**:
            - **Root Cause**: Fixed legacy logic in the auto-warmup scheduler that incorrectly mapped `gemini-2.5-flash` quota status to `gemini-3-flash`.
            - **Symptom**: This caused "ghost warmups" where `gemini-3-flash` was triggered for warmup even when it had 0% quota, just because `gemini-2.5-flash` (unused/different bucket) reported 100%.
            - **Fix**: Removed all hardcoded `2.5 -> 3` mapping logic. The scheduler now strictly checks the quota percentage of the specific model itself, triggering warmup only when that actual model reports 100%.
        - **Gemini 2.5 Pro Model Removal (Fix Issue #766)**:
            - **Reason**: Due to reliability issues, the `gemini-2.5-pro` model has been removed from the supported list.
            - **Migration**: All `gpt-4` family aliases (e.g., `gpt-4`, `gpt-4o`) have been remapped to `gemini-2.5-flash` to ensure service continuity.
            - **Impact**: Users previously accessing `gemini-2.5-pro` via aliases will be automatically routed to `gemini-2.5-flash`. The model is no longer selectable in the frontend.
        - **CLI Sync Safety & Backup (Fix Issue #756 & #765)**:
            - **Smart Backup & Restore**: Implemented an automatic backup mechanism. Before syncing, the system now automatically backs up existing configurations to `.antigravity.bak`. The "Restore" feature intelligently detects these backups and offers to restore the original user configuration instead of just resetting to defaults.
            - **Safety Confirmation**: Added a confirmation dialog for the "Sync Config" action to prevent accidental overwrites of local configurations.
            - **Enhanced CLI Detection**: Improved the detection logic for CLIs (like Claude Code) on macOS to correctly identify and execute binaries even if they are not in the system `PATH` but exist in standard fallback locations.
        - **Windows Console Flashing Fix (PR #769, Thanks to @i-smile)**:
            - **No Window Execution**: Fixed the issue where running CLI sync commands (like `where` checks) on Windows would briefly pop up a console window. Added `CREATE_NO_WINDOW` flag to ensure all background checks run silently.
        - **Auth UI Status Fix (PR #769, Thanks to @i-smile)**:
            - **Accurate Status**: Corrected the authentication status display logic in the API Proxy page. The UI now correctly shows "Disabled" when `auth_mode` is set to `off`, instead of incorrectly showing "Enabled".
    *   **v3.3.35 (2026-01-16)**:
        - **Major CLI Sync Enhancements**:
            - **Multi-config File Support**: Now supports syncing multiple configuration files for each CLI (Claude Code: `settings.json`, `.claude.json`; Codex: `auth.json`, `config.toml`; Gemini: `.env`, `settings.json`, `config.json`), ensuring a more complete setup.
            - **Claude No-Login Privilege**: Automatically injects `"hasCompletedOnboarding": true` into `~/.claude.json` during sync, allowing users to skip the initial onboarding/login steps for Claude CLI.
            - **Tabbed Config Viewer**: Upgraded the configuration viewer modal to a tabbed interface, enabling smooth switching between all associated config files for a single CLI.
        - **Deep UI/UX Refinements**:
            - **Unified Dialog Experience**: Replaced the native browser `window.confirm` for "Restore Default Configuration" with the app's themed `ModalDialog`.
            - **Icon & Badge Optimization**: Updated the restore button icon to `RotateCcw`, and streamlined status badge text with `whitespace-nowrap` to prevent layout breaks in tight spaces.
            - **Condensed Version Display**: Improved version extraction to display only pure numeric versions (e.g., v0.86.0) for a cleaner UI.
        - **Claude Thinking Signature Persistence Fix (Fix Issue #752)**:
            - **Root Cause**: 
                - **Response Collection**: The streaming response collector (`collector.rs`) in v3.3.34 missed the `signature` field of `thinking` blocks when processing `content_block_start` events, causing signature loss.
                - **Request Transformation**: Historical message signatures were sent to Gemini without validation, causing `Invalid signature in thinking block` errors during cross-model switches or cold starts.
            - **Fix Details**: 
                - **Response Collector**: Added logic to extract and persist the `signature` field in `collector.rs`, with unit test `test_collect_thinking_response_with_signature`.
                - **Request Transformer**: Implemented strict signature validation in `request.rs`. Only cached and compatible signatures are used. Unknown or incompatible signatures cause thinking blocks to downgrade to plain text, preventing invalid signatures from being sent.
                - **Fallback Mechanism**: Implemented intelligent fallback retry logic. If signature validation fails or the upstream API rejects the request (400 error), the system automatically clears all thinking blocks and forces a retry, ensuring the user's request always succeeds.
            - **Impact**: Completely resolved `Invalid signature in thinking block` errors, supporting cross-model switches and cold start scenarios, ensuring Thinking models work stably in all modes.
        - **API Monitor Real-time Sync Fix (Pull Request #747, Thanks to @xycxl)**:
            - **Root Cause**: Fixed issues with duplicate log entries and inaccurate counters in the API Monitor page caused by duplicate event listener registration and state desynchronization.
            - **Fix Details**:
                - **Data Deduplication**: Introduced `pendingLogsRef` and ID deduplication mechanisms to completely eliminate duplicate entries in the log list.
                - **Precise Counting**: Implemented strict frontend-backend state synchronization; the system now fetches authoritative `totalCount` from the backend with every new log batch, ensuring accurate pagination and total counts.
                - **Debounce Optimization**: Optimized log update debounce logic to reduce React re-renders and improve page smoothness.
                - **Feature Renaming**: Renamed "Call Records" to "Traffic Logs" and reverted the route to `/monitor` for a more intuitive experience.
    *   **v3.3.34 (2026-01-16)**:
        - **OpenAI Codex/Responses Protocol Fix (Fix Issue #742)**:
            - **400 Invalid Argument Complete Fix**:
                - **Root Cause**: The `/v1/responses` and other proprietary endpoints caused Gemini to receive empty bodies when the request body contained only `instructions` or `input` but lacked the `messages` field, as the transformation logic didn't cover all scenarios.
                - **Fix Details**: Backported the "request normalization" logic from the Chat interface to `handle_completions`. The system now forcibly detects Codex-specific fields (`instructions`/`input`), and even if `messages` is empty or missing, automatically transforms them into standard System/User message pairs, ensuring legal upstream requests.
            - **429/503 Advanced Retry & Account Rotation Support**:
                - **Logic Alignment**: Fully ported the "Smart Exponential Backoff" and "Multi-dimensional Account Rotation" strategies validated in the Claude processor to the OpenAI Completions interface.
                - **Effect**: Now, when the Codex interface encounters rate limiting or server overload, it automatically executes millisecond-level switching instead of throwing an error directly, greatly improving the stability of tools like VS Code plugins.
            - **Session Stickiness Support**:
                - **Feature Expansion**:completed the `session_id` extraction and scheduling logic under the OpenAI protocol. Now, whether it's Chat or Codex interface, as long as it's the same conversation, the system will try its best to schedule it to the same Google account.
                - **Performance Bonus**: This will significantly increase the hit rate of Google Prompt Caching, thereby drastically speeding up response times and saving computing resources.
        - **Claude Thinking Signature Encoding Fix (Fix Issue #726)**:
            - **Root Cause**: Fixed a regression introduced in v3.3.33, where the already Base64-encoded `thoughtSignature` was incorrectly re-encoded in Base64. This doubled encoding caused Google Vertex AI to fail signature verification, returning an `Invalid signature` error.
            - **Fix Details**: Removed redundant Base64 encoding steps in the `Thinking`, `ToolUse`, and `ToolResult` processing logic, ensuring the signature is passed through to the upstream in its original valid format.
            - **Impact**: Completely resolved the 400 signature error triggered when using Thinking models (e.g., Claude 4.5 Opus / Sonnet) in multi-turn conversations, as well as the resulting "Error searching files" infinite loop (Issue #737).
        - **API Monitor Refresh Fix (Fix Issue #735)**:
            - **Root Cause**: Fixed the issue where new requests were not automatically appearing in the API Monitor list due to a Closure-related bug in the event listener.
            - **Fix Details**: Optimized the event buffering logic using `useRef`, added a manual Refresh button as a backup, and explicitly enabled Tauri event permissions.
        - **Strict Grouped Quota Protection Fix (Core Thanks to @Mag1cFall PR #746)**:
            - **Root Cause**: Fixed an issue where quota protection failed in strict matching mode due to case sensitivity and missing frontend UI key mapping. Previously, UI shorthand keys like `gemini-pro` could not match the backend-defined `gemini-3-pro-high` strict group.
            - **Fix Details**:
                - **Instant Case Normalization**: Restored case-insensitive matching in backend `normalize_to_standard_id`, ensuring variants like `Gemini-3-Pro-High` are correctly recognized.
                - **Smart UI Key Mapping**: Added automatic mapping for UI column names like `gemini-pro/flash` in frontend `isModelProtected`, ensuring lock icons correctly reflect backend protection status.
            - **Impact**: Completely resolved lock icon display issues for Gemini 3 Pro/Flash and Claude 4.5 Sonnet in strict grouping mode, ensuring intuitive visual feedback when quotas are exhausted.
        - **OpenAI Protocol Usage Statistics Fix (Pull Request #749, Thanks to @stillyun)**:
            - **Root Cause**: During OpenAI protocol conversion, Gemini's `usageMetadata` was not mapped to the `usage` field in OpenAI format, causing clients like Kilo to show zero token usage.
            - **Fix Details**:
                - **Data Model Completion**: Added standard `usage` field to `OpenAIResponse`.
                - **Full-Chain Mapping**: Implemented logic to extract and map `prompt_tokens`, `completion_tokens`, and `total_tokens` from both streaming (SSE) and non-streaming responses.
            - **Impact**: Completely resolved the issue where tools like Kilo Editor and Claude Code could not track token usage when using the OpenAI protocol.
        - **Linux Theme Switch Crash Fix (Pull Request #750, Thanks to @infinitete)**:
            - **Fix Details**:
                - Disabled incompatible `setBackgroundColor` calls on Linux platform.
                - Disabled View Transition API for WebKitGTK environments to prevent transparent window crashes.
                - Automatically adjusted GTK window alpha channel at startup for enhanced stability.
            - **Impact**: Resolved potential program freezes or hard crashes for Linux users when switching between dark/light modes.
    *   **v3.3.33 (2026-01-15)**:
        - **Codex Compatibility & Model Mapping Fix (Fix Issue #697)**:
            - **Instructions Parameter Support**: Fixed the handling of the `instructions` parameter, ensuring it is correctly injected as System Instructions for better compatibility with tools like Codex.
            - **Automatic Responses Format Detection**: Added intelligent detection in the OpenAI handler to automatically recognize and transform `instructions` or `input` fields into Responses mode.
            - **Model Mapping Restoration & Normalization**: Restored the logic that normalizes `gemini-3-pro-low/high/pro` to the internal alias `gemini-3-pro-preview`, with proper restoration to the physical `high` model name for upstream requests.
            - **Opus Mapping Enhancement**: Optimized default mappings to recognize `opus` keywords and ensure they route to the high-performance Pro preview tier by default.
        - **OpenAI Tool Call ID & Reasoning Content Fix (Fix Issue #710)**:
            - **Preserve Tool Call ID**: Resolved the issue where `tool_use.id` was lost during OpenAI format conversion, ensuring both `functionCall` and `functionResponse` retain original IDs, fixing the `Field required` error when calling Claude models.
            - **Native Reasoning Support**: Added support for the `reasoning_content` field in OpenAI messages, correctly mapping it to internal `thought` blocks and injecting chain-of-thought signatures.
            - **Tool Response Optimization**: Fixed redundant part conflicts in `tool` role messages, ensuring strict compliance with upstream payload validation.
        - **External Provider Smart Fallback Fix (Fix Issue #703)**: Fixed the issue where "Fallback only" mode failed to automatically switch to external providers when Google account quotas were exhausted.
            - **Core Problem**: The original logic only checked if the number of Google accounts was 0, without checking account availability (rate-limit status, quota protection status), causing direct 429 errors when accounts existed but were unavailable.
            - **Solution**: Implemented smart account availability checking mechanism. Added `has_available_account()` method in `TokenManager` to comprehensively assess account rate-limit and quota protection status.
            - **Modified Files**:
                - `token_manager.rs`: Added `has_available_account()` method to check for available accounts that are not rate-limited or quota-protected
                - `handlers/claude.rs`: Optimized Fallback mode logic from simple `google_accounts == 0` to intelligent availability check
            - **Behavior Improvement**: When all Google accounts are unavailable due to rate-limiting, quota protection, or other reasons, the system automatically switches to external providers, achieving true smart fallback.
            - **Impact**: This fix ensures external providers (e.g., Zhipu API) "Fallback only" mode works correctly, significantly improving service availability in multi-account scenarios.
        - **Quota Protection Model Name Normalization Fix (Fix Issue #685)**: Fixed the issue where quota protection failed due to model name mismatches.
            - **Core Problem**: Model names returned by the Quota API (e.g., `gemini-2.5-flash`) didn't match the standard names in the UI (e.g., `gemini-3-flash`), causing string matching failures and preventing protection triggers.
            - **Solution**: Implemented a unified model name normalization engine `normalize_to_standard_id`, mapping all physical model names to three standard protection IDs:
                - `gemini-3-flash`: All Flash variants (1.5-flash, 2.5-flash, 3-flash, etc.)
                - `gemini-3-pro-high`: All Pro variants (1.5-pro, 2.5-pro, etc.)
                - `claude-sonnet-4-5`: All Claude Sonnet variants (3.5-sonnet, sonnet-4-5, etc.)
            - **Modified Files**:
                - `model_mapping.rs`: Added normalization functions.
                - `account.rs`: Normalizes model names when updating quotas and stores the standard ID.
                - `token_manager.rs`: Normalizes `target_model` for matching during request interception.
            - **Web Search Downgrade Scenario**: Even if a request is downgraded to `gemini-2.5-flash` due to web search, it is correctly normalized to `gemini-3-flash` and triggers protection.
            - **Impact**: Completely resolved quota protection failure, ensuring all three monitored models work correctly.
        - **New Account Import Feature (#682)**: Supports batch importing existing accounts via exported JSON files, completing the account migration loop.
        - **New Portuguese & Russian Support (#691, #713)**: Portuguese (Brazil) and Russian localizations are now supported.
        - **Proxy Monitor Enhancement (#676)**: Added "Copy" buttons for request and response payloads in the proxy monitor details page, with support for automatic JSON formatting.
        - **i18n Fixes (#671, #713)**: Corrected misplaced translation keys in Japanese (ja), Turkish (tr), and Russian (ru).
        - **Global HTTP API (#696)**: Added a local HTTP server port (default 19527), allowing external tools (like VS Code extensions) to switch accounts, refresh quotas, and bind devices directly via API.
        - **Proxy Monitor Upgrade (#704)**: Completely refactored the monitor dashboard with backend pagination (supporting search filters), resolving UI lag caused by massive logs; exposed `GET /logs` endpoint for external access.
        - **Warmup Strategy Optimization (#699)**: Added unique `session_id` to warmup requests, limited `max_tokens` to 8, and set `temperature` to 0 to reduce resource consumption and avoid 429 errors.
        - **Warmup Logic Fix & Optimization**: Fixed an issue where manual warmup triggers didn't record history, causing redundant auto-warmups; optimized scheduler to skip accounts with "Proxy Disabled" status.
        - **Performance Mode Scheduling Optimization (PR #706)**: In "Performance First" scheduling mode, the default 60-second global lock mechanism is now skipped, significantly improving account rotation efficiency in high-concurrency scenarios.
        - **Rate Limit Auto-Cleanup (PR #701)**: Introduced a background cleanup task running every minute to automatically remove expired failure records older than 1 hour, completely resolving false "No available accounts" alerts caused by accumulated historical records during long-term operation.
        - **API Monitor Stale Data Fix (Fix Issue #708)**: Enabled SQLite WAL mode and optimized connection configuration, completely resolving stale monitor data and proxy service 400/429 errors caused by database locking under high concurrency.
        - **Claude Prompt Filtering Optimization (#712)**: Fixed an issue where user custom instructions (Instructions from: ...) were accidentally removed when filtering redundant Claude Code default prompts, ensuring personalized configurations persist in long conversation scenarios.
        - **Claude Thinking Block Ordering Optimization (Fix Issue #709)**: Completely resolved `INVALID_ARGUMENT` errors caused by incorrect block ordering (Text appearing before Thinking) when thinking mode is enabled.
            - **Triple-Stage Partitioning**: Implemented strict `[Thinking, Text, ToolUse]` order validation.
            - **Automatic Downgrade Gateway**: Within a single message, any thinking blocks appearing after non-thinking content are automatically downgraded to text to ensure protocol compliance.
            - **Post-Merge Reordering**: Added a mandatory reordering step after Assistant message merging to prevent ordering violations caused by concatenation.
    *   **v3.3.32 (2026-01-15)**:
        - **Core Scheduling & Stability Optimization (Fix Issue #630, #631 - Special Thanks to @lbjlaq PR #640)**:
            - **Quota Vulnerability & Bypass Fix**: Resolved potential vulnerabilities where quota protection mechanisms could be bypassed under high concurrency or specific retry scenarios.
            - **Rate-Limit Key Matching Optimization**: Enhanced the precision of rate-limit record matching in `TokenManager`, resolving inconsistent rate-limit judgments in multi-instance or complex network environments.
            - **Account Disabling Enforcement**: Fixed an issue where manually disabled accounts were not immediately removed from the scheduling pool during certain cache lifecycles, ensuring "disable on click".
            - **Account State Reset Mechanism**: Refined the strategy for resetting account failure counters after successful requests, preventing accounts from being incorrectly locked for long periods due to historical fluctuations.
    *   **v3.3.31 (2026-01-14)**:
        - **Quota Protection Fix (Fix Issue #631)**:
            - **In-Memory State Sync**: Fixed an issue where in-memory account state was not synchronized immediately when quota protection was triggered during load.

            - **Format Validation**: Added API key format validation (must start with `sk-` and be at least 10 characters long) to prevent invalid input.
            - **Multi-language Support**: Complete internationalization translations added for all 6 supported languages (Simplified Chinese, English, Traditional Chinese, Japanese, Turkish, Vietnamese).
    *   **v3.3.29 (2026-01-14)**:
        - **OpenAI Streaming Function Call Support Fix (Fix Issue #602, #614)**:
            - **Background**: OpenAI interface streaming responses (`stream: true`) lacked Function Call processing logic, preventing clients from receiving tool call information.
            - **Root Cause**: The `create_openai_sse_stream` function only handled text content, thinking content, and images, completely missing `functionCall` processing.
            - **Fix Details**:
                - Added tool call state tracking variable (`emitted_tool_calls`) to prevent duplicate sends
                - Added `functionCall` detection and conversion logic in parts loop
                - Built OpenAI-compliant `delta.tool_calls` array
                - Used hash algorithm to generate stable `call_id`
                - Included complete tool call information (`index`, `id`, `type`, `function.name`, `function.arguments`)
            - **Impact**: This fix ensures streaming requests correctly return tool call information, maintaining consistency with non-streaming responses and Codex streaming responses. All clients using `stream: true` + `tools` parameters can now properly receive Function Call data.
        - **Smart Threshold Recovery - Resolve Issue #613**:

    *   **v3.3.28 (2026-01-14)**:
        - **OpenAI Thinking Content Fix (PR #604)**:
            - **Fixed Gemini 3 Pro Thinking Content Loss**: Added `reasoning_content` accumulation logic in streaming response collector, resolving the issue where Gemini 3 Pro (high/low) non-streaming responses lost thinking content.
            - **Support for Claude *-thinking Models**: Extended thinking model detection logic to support all models ending with `-thinking` (e.g., `claude-opus-4-5-thinking`, `claude-sonnet-4-5-thinking`), automatically injecting `thinkingConfig` to ensure proper thinking content output.
            - **Unified Thinking Configuration**: Injected unified `thinkingBudget: 16000` configuration for all thinking models (Gemini 3 Pro and Claude thinking series), complying with Cloud Code API specifications.
            - **Impact**: This fix ensures the `reasoning_content` field works properly for Gemini 3 Pro and Claude Thinking models under OpenAI protocol, without affecting Anthropic and Gemini native protocols.
        - **Experimental Config Hot Reload (PR #605)**:
            - **Added Hot Reload Support**: Added hot reload mechanism for `ExperimentalConfig`, consistent with other config items (mapping, proxy, security, zai, scheduling).
            - **Real-time Effect**: Users can modify experimental feature switches without restarting the application, improving configuration adjustment convenience.
            - **Architecture Enhancement**: Added `experimental` field storage and `update_experimental()` method in `AxumServer`, automatically triggering hot reload in `save_config`.
        - **Smart Warmup Strategy Optimization (PR #606 - 2.9x-5x Performance Boost)**:
            - **Separated Refresh and Warmup**: Removed automatic warmup trigger during quota refresh. Warmup now only triggers via scheduler (every 10 minutes) or manual button, avoiding accidental quota consumption when users refresh quotas.
            - **Extended Cooldown Period**: Cooldown period extended from 30 minutes to 4 hours (14400 seconds), matching Pro account 5-hour reset cycle, completely resolving repeated warmup within the same cycle.
            - **Persistent History Records**: Warmup history saved to `~/.antigravity_tools/warmup_history.json`, cooldown period remains effective after program restart, resolving state loss issue.
            - **Concurrent Execution Optimization**: 
                - Filtering phase: 5 accounts per batch concurrent quota fetching, 10 accounts from ~15s to ~3s (5x improvement)
                - Warmup phase: 3 tasks per batch concurrent execution with 2s interval, 40 tasks from ~80s to ~28s (2.9x improvement)
            - **Whitelist Filtering**: Only records and warms up 4 core model groups (`gemini-3-flash`, `claude-sonnet-4-5`, `gemini-3-pro-high`, `gemini-3-pro-image`), avoiding bloated history records.
            - **Record After Success**: Failed warmups are not recorded in history, allowing retry next time, improving fault tolerance.
            - **Manual Warmup Protection**: Manual warmup also respects 4-hour cooldown period, filters already-warmed models and displays skip count, preventing users from repeatedly clicking and wasting quota.
            - **Enhanced Logging**: Added detailed logs for scheduler scanning, warmup start/completion, cooldown skips, facilitating monitoring and debugging.
            - **Impact**: This optimization significantly improves smart warmup performance and reliability, resolving multiple issues including repeated warmup, slow speed, and state loss. Concurrency level won't trigger RateLimit.

    *   **v3.3.26 (2026-01-13)**:
        - **Quota Protection & Scheduling Optimization (Fix Issue #595 - Zero Quota Accounts in Queue)**:
            - **Quota Protection Logic Refactor**: Fixed the issue where quota protection failed due to reliance on non-existent `limit/remaining` fields. It now directly uses the `percentage` field, ensuring that accounts are immediately disabled if any monitored model (e.g., Claude 4.5 Sonnet) falls below the threshold.
            - **Priority Algorithm Upgrade**: Account scheduling priority is no longer solely based on subscription tiers. Within the same tier (Ultra/Pro/Free), the system now prioritizes accounts with the **highest maximum remaining percentage**, preventing "squeezing" of near-empty accounts and significantly reducing 429 errors.
            - **Enhanced Protection Logs**: Logs when quota protection is triggered now explicitly state which model triggered the threshold (e.g., `quota_protection: claude-sonnet-4-5 (0% <= 10%)`), facilitating troubleshooting.
        - **MCP Tool Compatibility Enhancement (Fix Issue #593)**:
            - **Deep cache_control Cleanup**: Implemented multi-layer `cache_control` field cleanup mechanism, completely resolving "Extra inputs are not permitted" errors caused by `cache_control` in thinking blocks when using tools like Chrome Dev Tools MCP.

                - **Recursive Deep Cleanup**: Added `deep_clean_cache_control()` function to recursively traverse all nested objects and arrays, removing `cache_control` fields from any location.
                - **Final Safety Net**: Performs deep cleanup again after building Gemini request body and before sending, ensuring no `cache_control` fields are sent to Antigravity.
            - **Smart Tool Output Compression**: Added `tool_result_compressor` module to handle oversized tool outputs, reducing 429 error probability caused by excessive prompt length.
                - **Browser Snapshot Compression**: Automatically detects and compresses browser snapshots exceeding 20,000 characters, using head (70%) + tail (30%) retention strategy with middle omission.
                - **Large File Notice Compression**: Intelligently identifies "exceeds maximum allowed tokens" pattern, extracts key information (file path, character count, format description), significantly reducing redundant content.
                - **General Truncation**: Truncates tool outputs exceeding 200,000 characters with clear truncation notices.
                - **Base64 Image Removal**: Automatically removes base64-encoded images from tool results to avoid excessive size.

            - **Priority Lookup Strategy**: Implements Session Cache → Tool Cache → Global Store three-layer lookup priority, maximizing signature recovery success rate.
        - **Session ID Generation Optimization**:
            - **Simple Design**: Only hashes the first user message content, without mixing model names or timestamps, ensuring session continuity.
            - **Perfect Continuity**: All turns of the same conversation (regardless of how many) use the same session_id, with no time limit.
            - **Performance Improvement**: Compared to previous solutions, CPU overhead reduced by 60%, code lines reduced by 20%.
        - **Cache Management Optimization**:

            - **Lock Contention Optimization**: Moved `last_used_account` lock acquisition outside the retry loop, reducing lock operations from 18 to 1-2 per request, dramatically decreasing lock contention in concurrent scenarios.
            - **5-Second Timeout Protection**: Added a 5-second mandatory timeout for `get_token()` operations to prevent indefinite hangs during system overload or deadlock.
            - **Impact**: This optimization significantly improves stability in multi-Agent concurrent scenarios (such as Claude Code, Cursor, etc.), completely resolving the "headless request" deadlock issue.
        - **Linux System Compatibility (Core Thanks to @0-don PR #326)**:
            - **Transparent Window Fix**: Automatically disables DMA-BUF renderer (`WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1`) on Linux systems to resolve transparent window rendering or black screen issues in some distributions.
        - **Monitor Middleware Optimization (Core Thanks to @Mag1cFall PR #346)**:
            - **Payload Limit Alignment**: Increased request body limit for monitor middleware from 1MB to 100MB, ensuring large image requests are correctly logged and displayed.
        - **OpenAI Protocol Multi-Candidate Support (Core Thanks to @ThanhNguyxn PR #403)**:
            - Implemented support for the `n` parameter, allowing a single request to return multiple candidates.
            - Added the multi-candidate support patch for streaming responses (SSE), ensuring cross-platform functional parity.
        - **Web Search Enhancement & Citation Optimization**:
            - Re-implemented web search source display using a more readable Markdown citation format (including titles and links).
            - Resolved the issue where citation display logic was disabled in previous versions; it is now fully enabled in both streaming and non-streaming modes.
        - **Installation & Distribution (Core Thanks to @dlukt PR #396)**:
            - **Linux Cask Support**: Refactored Cask file for multi-platform support. Linux users can now install via `brew install --cask` with automatic AppImage permission configuration.
        - **Comprehensive Logging System Optimization (Issue #241 Fix)**:
        - **Comprehensive Logging System Optimization (Issue #241 Fix)**:
            - **Log Level Optimization**: Downgraded high-frequency debug logs for tool calls and parameter remapping from `info!` to `debug!`, dramatically reducing log output volume.
            - **Automatic Cleanup Mechanism**: Application startup now automatically cleans up log files older than 7 days, preventing indefinite log accumulation.
            - **Significant Impact**: Log file size reduced from 130GB/day to < 100MB/day, a **99.9%** reduction in log output.
            - **Scope**: Modified 21 log level statements in `streaming.rs` and `response.rs`, added `cleanup_old_logs()` automatic cleanup function.
    *   **v3.3.15 (2026-01-04)**:
        - **Claude Protocol Compatibility Enhancements** (Based on PR #296 by @karasungur + Issue #298 Fix):
            - **Fixed Opus 4.5 First Request Error (Issue #298)**: Extended signature pre-flight validation to all first-time thinking requests, not just function call scenarios. When using models like `claude-opus-4-5-thinking` for the first request, if there's no valid signature, the system automatically disables thinking mode to avoid API rejection, resolving the "Server disconnected without sending a response" error.
            - **Function Call Signature Validation (Issue #295)**: Added pre-flight signature validation. When thinking is enabled but function calls lack a valid signature, thinking is automatically disabled to prevent Gemini 3 Pro from rejecting requests.
            - **cache_control Cleanup (Issue #290)**: Implemented recursive deep cleanup to remove `cache_control` fields from all nested objects/arrays, resolving Anthropic API (z.ai mode) "Extra inputs are not permitted" errors.
            - **Tool Parameter Remapping**: Automatically corrects parameter names used by Gemini (Grep/Glob: `query` → `pattern`, Read: `path` → `file_path`), resolving Claude Code tool call validation errors.
            - **Configurable Safety Settings**: Added `GEMINI_SAFETY_THRESHOLD` environment variable supporting 5 safety levels (OFF/LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/NONE), defaulting to OFF for backward compatibility.
            - **Effort Parameter Support**: Supports Claude API v2.0.67+ `output_config.effort` parameter, allowing fine-grained control over model reasoning effort.
            - **Opus 4.5 Default Thinking**: Aligned with Claude Code v2.0.67+, Opus 4.5 models now enable thinking mode by default, with signature validation for graceful degradation.
            - **Retry Jitter Optimization**: Added ±20% random jitter to all retry strategies to prevent thundering herd effect, improving stability in high-concurrency scenarios.
            - **Signature Capture Improvement**: Immediately captures signatures from thinking blocks, reducing signature missing errors in multi-turn conversations.
            - **Impact**: These improvements significantly enhance compatibility and stability for Claude Code, Cursor, Cherry Studio and other clients, especially in Opus 4.5 models, tool calling, and multi-turn conversation scenarios.
    *   **v3.3.14 (2026-01-03)**:
        - **Claude Protocol Robustness Improvements** (Core Thanks to @karasungur PR #289):
            - **Thinking Block Signature Validation Enhancement**:
                - Support for empty thinking blocks with valid signatures (trailing signature scenario)
                - Invalid signature blocks gracefully degrade to text instead of being dropped, preserving content to avoid data loss
                - Enhanced debugging logs for signature issue troubleshooting
            - **Tool/Function Calling Compatibility Optimization**:
                - Extracted web search fallback model to named constant `WEB_SEARCH_FALLBACK_MODEL` for improved maintainability
                - Automatically skips googleSearch injection when MCP tools are present to avoid conflicts
                - Added informative logging for debugging tool calling scenarios
                - **Important Note**: Gemini Internal API does not support mixing `functionDeclarations` and `googleSearch`
            - **SSE Parse Error Recovery Mechanism**:
                - Added `parse_error_count` and `last_valid_state` tracking for streaming response error monitoring
                - Implemented `handle_parse_error()` for graceful stream degradation
                - Implemented `reset_error_state()` for post-error recovery
                - Implemented `get_error_count()` for error count retrieval
                - High error rate warning system (>5 errors) for operational monitoring
                - Detailed debugging logs supporting troubleshooting of corrupted streams
            - **Impact**: These improvements significantly enhance stability for Claude CLI, Cursor, Cherry Studio and other clients, especially in multi-turn conversations, tool calling, and streaming response scenarios.
        - **Dashboard Statistics Fix** (Core Thanks to @yinjianhong22-design PR #285):
            - **Fixed Low Quota Statistics False Positives**: Fixed the issue where disabled accounts (403 status) were incorrectly counted in "Low Quota" statistics
            - **Logic Optimization**: Added `is_forbidden` check in `lowQuotaCount` filter to exclude disabled accounts
            - **Data Accuracy Improvement**: Dashboard now accurately reflects the true number of low-quota active accounts, avoiding false positives
            - **Impact**: Improved dashboard data accuracy and user experience, allowing users to more clearly understand which accounts need attention.
    *   **v3.3.13 (2026-01-03)**:
        - **Thinking Mode Stability Fixes**:
            - **Fixed Empty Thinking Content Error**: When clients send empty Thinking blocks, they are now automatically downgraded to plain text blocks to avoid `thinking: Field required` errors.
            - **Fixed Validation Error After Smart Downgrade**: When Thinking is disabled via smart downgrade (e.g., incompatible history), all Thinking blocks in historical messages are automatically converted to plain text, resolving "thinking is disabled but message contains thinking" errors.
            - **Fixed Model Switching Signature Error**: Added target model Thinking support detection. When switching from Claude thinking models to regular Gemini models (e.g., `gemini-2.5-flash`), Thinking is automatically disabled and historical messages are downgraded to avoid "Corrupted thought signature" errors. Only models with `-thinking` suffix (e.g., `gemini-2.5-flash-thinking`) or Claude models support Thinking.
            - **Impact**: These fixes ensure stability across various model switching scenarios, especially for seamless Claude ↔ Gemini transitions.
        - **Account Rotation Rate-Limiting Mechanism Optimization (Critical Fix for Issue #278)**:
            - **Fixed Rate-Limit Time Parsing Failure**: Completely resolved the issue where Google API's `quotaResetDelay` could not be correctly parsed.
                - **Corrected JSON Parsing Path**: Fixed the extraction path for `quotaResetDelay` from `details[0].quotaResetDelay` to `details[0].metadata.quotaResetDelay`, matching Google API's actual JSON structure.
                - **Implemented Universal Time Parsing**: Added `parse_duration_string()` function to support parsing all time formats returned by Google API, including complex combinations like `"2h21m25.831582438s"`, `"1h30m"`, `"5m"`, `"30s"`, etc.
                - **Differentiated Rate-Limit Types**: Added `RateLimitReason` enum to distinguish between `QUOTA_EXHAUSTED` (quota exhausted) and `RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` (rate limit) types, setting different default wait times based on type (quota exhausted: 1 hour, rate limit: 30 seconds).
            - **Problem Before Fix**: When account quota was exhausted triggering 429 errors, the system could not parse the accurate reset time returned by Google API (e.g., `"2h21m25s"`), resulting in using a fixed default value of 60 seconds. Accounts were incorrectly considered "recoverable in 1 minute" when they actually needed 2 hours, causing accounts to fall into a 429 loop, using only the first 2 accounts while subsequent accounts were never utilized.
            - **Effect After Fix**: The system can now accurately parse the reset time returned by Google API (e.g., `"2h21m25.831582438s"` → 8485 seconds). Accounts are correctly marked as rate-limited and wait for the accurate time, ensuring all accounts can be properly rotated and used, completely resolving the "only using first 2 accounts" issue.
            - **Impact**: This fix significantly improves stability and availability in multi-account environments, ensuring all accounts are fully utilized and avoiding account rotation failures caused by rate-limit time parsing errors.
    *   **v3.3.12 (2026-01-02)**:
        - **Critical Fixes**:
            - **Fix Antigravity Thinking Signature Errors**: Completely resolved `400: thinking.signature: Field required` errors when using the Antigravity (Google API) channel.
                - **Disabled Dummy Thinking Block Injection**: Removed logic that auto-injected unsigned "Thinking..." placeholder blocks for historical messages. Google API rejects any thinking blocks without valid signatures.
                - **Removed Fake Signature Fallback**: Removed logic that added `skip_thought_signature_validator` sentinel values to ToolUse and Thinking blocks. Now only uses real signatures or omits the thoughtSignature field entirely.
                - **Fixed Background Task Misclassification**: Removed the "Caveat: The messages below were generated" keyword to prevent normal requests containing Claude Desktop system prompts from being misclassified as background tasks and downgraded to Flash Lite models.
                - **Impact**: This fix ensures stability for Claude CLI, Cursor, Cherry Studio, and other clients when using the Antigravity proxy, especially in multi-turn conversations and tool calling scenarios.
    *   **v3.3.11 (2026-01-02)**:
        - **Critical Fixes**:
            - **Cherry Studio Compatibility Fix (Gemini 3)**:
                - **Removed Forced Prompt Injection**: Removed the mandatory "Coding Agent" system instruction and Gemini 3 user message suffix injections. This resolves the issue where `gemini-3-flash` would output confused responses (like "Thinking Process" or "Actually, the instruction says...") in general-purpose clients like Cherry Studio. The generic OpenAI protocol now respects the original user prompt faithfully.
            - **Fix Gemini 3 Python Client Crash**:
                - **Removed maxOutputTokens Restriction**: Removed the logic that forcibly set `maxOutputTokens: 64000` for Gemini requests. This forced setting caused standard Gemini 3 Flash/Pro models (limit 8192) to reject requests and return empty responses, triggering `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'strip'` errors in Python clients. The proxy now defaults to the model's native limit or respects client parameters.
        - **Core Optimization**:
            - **Unified Retry Backoff System**: Refactored error retry logic with intelligent backoff strategies tailored to different error types:
                - **Thinking Signature Failure (400)**: Fixed 200ms delay before retry, avoiding request doubling from immediate retries.
                - **Server Overload (529/503)**: Exponential backoff (1s/2s/4s/8s), significantly improving recovery success rate by 167%.
                - **Rate Limiting (429)**: Prioritizes server-provided Retry-After, otherwise uses linear backoff (1s/2s/3s).
                - **Account Protection**: Server-side errors (529/503) no longer rotate accounts, preventing healthy account pool contamination.
                - **Unified Logging**: All backoff operations use ⏱️ identifier for easy monitoring and debugging.
        - **Critical Fix**:
            - **Fixed Gemini 3 Python Client Crash**: Removed the logic that forced `maxOutputTokens: 64000` for Gemini requests. This override caused standard Gemini 3 Flash/Pro models (limit 8192) to reject requests with empty responses, leading to `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'strip'` errors in Python clients. The proxy now defaults to model native limits or respects client parameters.
        - **Scoop Installation Compatibility Support (Core Thanks to @Small-Ku PR #252)**:

            - **Multi-Endpoint Auto-Switching**: Implemented `prod → daily` dual-endpoint fallback strategy. Automatically switches to backup endpoint when primary returns 404/429/5xx, significantly improving service availability.
            - **Connection Pool Optimization**: Added `pool_max_idle_per_host(16)`, `tcp_keepalive(60s)` and other parameters to optimize connection reuse and reduce establishment overhead, especially optimized for WSL/Windows environments.
            - **Smart Retry Logic**: Supports automatic endpoint switching for 408 Request Timeout, 404 Not Found, 429 Too Many Requests, and 5xx Server Errors.
            - **Detailed Logging**: Records INFO logs on successful fallback and WARN logs on failures for operational monitoring and troubleshooting.
            - **Fully Compatible with Scheduling Modes**: Endpoint fallback and account scheduling (Cache First/Balance/Performance First) work at different layers without interference, ensuring cache hit rates remain unaffected.
        - 📊 **Comprehensive Logging System Optimization**:
            - **Log Level Restructuring**: Strictly separated INFO/DEBUG/TRACE levels. INFO now only shows critical business information, with detailed debugging downgraded to DEBUG.
            - **Heartbeat Request Filtering**: Downgraded heartbeat requests (`/api/event_logging/batch`, `/healthz`) from INFO to TRACE, completely eliminating log noise.
            - **Account Information Display**: Shows account email at request start and completion for easy monitoring of account usage and session stickiness debugging.
            - **Streaming Response Completion Markers**: Added completion logs for streaming responses (including token statistics), ensuring full request lifecycle traceability.
            - **90%+ Log Volume Reduction**: Normal requests reduced from 50+ lines to 3-5 lines, startup logs from 30+ to 6 lines, dramatically improving readability.
            - **Debug Mode**: Use `RUST_LOG=debug` to view full request/response JSON for deep debugging.
        - 🎨 **Imagen 3 Generation Enhancements**:
            - **New Resolution Support**: Added support for `-2k` resolution via model name suffixes for higher definitions.
            - **Ultra-wide Aspect Ratio**: Added support for `-21x9` (or `-21-9`) aspect ratio, perfect for ultra-wide displays.
            - **Mapping Optimization**: Improved auto-mapping logic for custom sizes like `2560x1080`.
            - **Full Protocol Coverage**: These enhancements are available across OpenAI, Claude, and Gemini protocols.
        - 🔍 **Model Detection API**:
            - **New Detection Endpoint**: Introduced `POST /v1/models/detect` to reveal model capabilities and configuration variants in real-time.
            - **Dynamic Model List**: The `/v1/models` API now dynamically lists all resolution and aspect ratio combinations for image models (e.g., `gemini-3-pro-image-4k-21x9`).
        - 🐛 **Background Task Downgrade Model Fix**:
            - **Fixed 404 Errors**: Corrected background task downgrade model from non-existent `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` to `gemini-2.5-flash-lite`, resolving 404 errors for title generation, summaries, and other background tasks.
        - 🔐 **Manual Account Disable Feature**:
            - **Independent Disable Control**: Added manual account disable feature, distinct from 403 disable. Only affects proxy pool, not API requests.
            - **Application Usable**: Manually disabled accounts can still be switched and used within the application, view quota details, only removed from proxy pool.
            - **Visual Distinction**: 403 disable shows red "Disabled" badge, manual disable shows orange "Proxy Disabled" badge.
            - **Batch Operations**: Supports batch disable/enable multiple accounts for improved management efficiency.

        - **Automatic Account Exception Handling (Core Thanks to @salacoste PR #203)**:

            - **Auto-disable Invalid Accounts**: Automatically marks accounts as disabled when Google OAuth refresh tokens become invalid (`invalid_grant`), preventing proxy failures caused by repeated attempts to use broken accounts.
            - **Persistent State Management**: Disabling state is saved to disk and persists across restarts. Optimized loading logic to skip disabled accounts.
            - **Smart Auto-recovery**: Accounts are automatically re-enabled when the user manually updates the refresh or access tokens in the UI.
            - **Documentation**: Added detailed documentation for the invalid grant handling mechanism.
        - **Dynamic Model List API (Intelligent Endpoint Optimization)**:
            - **Real-time Dynamic Sync**: `/v1/models` (OpenAI) and `/v1/models/claude` (Claude) endpoints now aggregate built-in and custom mappings in real-time. Changes in settings take effect instantly.
            - **Full Model Support**: Prefix filtering is removed. Users can now directly see and use image models like `gemini-3-pro-image-4k-16x9` and all custom IDs in terminals or clients.
        - **Quota Management & Intelligent Routing (Operational Optimization & Bug Fixes)**:
            - **Background Task Smart Downgrading**: Automatically identifies and reroutes Claude CLI/Agent background tasks (titles, summaries, etc.) to Flash models, fixing the issue where these requests previously consumed premium/long-context quotas.
            - **Concurrency Lock & Quota Protection**: Fixed the issue where multiple concurrent requests caused account quota overflow. Atomic locks ensure account consistency within the same session, preventing unnecessary rotations.
